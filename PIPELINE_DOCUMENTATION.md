## Technical Implementation

### Inlined Dependencies
All pipelines now include inline implementations of:
- **Script Expansion**: LLM-powered script enhancement
- **Combat Scene Generation**: Dynamic choreography creation
- **Video Generation**: High-quality text-to-video synthesis
- **Voice Generation**: Multi-language TTS with Bark/XTTS
- **Music Generation**: Background music with MusicGen
- **Frame Interpolation**: AI-powered smooth motion
- **Video Upscaling**: RealESRGAN integration
- **Character Memory**: Consistency across episodes
- **YouTube Metadata**: AI-generated titles and descriptions

### Quality Settings (All Pipelines)
```python
# Video Quality
bitrate = '12000k'
preset = 'veryslow'
crf = '15'
resolution = '1920x1080'
fps = 60

# AI Model Quality
guidance_scale = 15.0
num_inference_steps = 100
eta = 0.0  # Deterministic
sample_rate = 48000  # Audio
```

### Character Consistency System
All pipelines use `CharacterMemoryManager` for:
- Character reference image storage
- Consistent character parameters across episodes
- Multi-angle character views
- Character seed persistence
- Cross-episode character tracking

### YouTube Metadata Generation
Each pipeline generates:
- **title.txt**: AI-generated compelling titles
- **description.txt**: Detailed episode descriptions
- **next_episode.txt**: LLM-powered next episode suggestions
- **manifest.json**: Complete pipeline metadata

## GUI Integration

### Character Image Selection Widget
New GUI component for character management:
- Add/remove characters per project
- Upload reference images for consistency
- Load characters from previous projects
- Character description management
- Visual character gallery

### Project Creation Integration
Enhanced NewProjectDialog includes:
- Character selection and management
- Advanced quality settings
- Frame interpolation controls
- Upscaling options
- Combat scene configuration
- LLM model selection

## Database Integration
Maintained full database compatibility:
- **DBProject**: Project storage with character data
- **DBPipelineRun**: Progress tracking and status
- **API Integration**: RESTful project management
- **GUI Synchronization**: Real-time updates

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Anime Episode
```python
from backend.pipelines.channel_specific.anime_pipeline import AnimePipeline

pipeline = AnimePipeline()
result = pipeline.run(
    input_path="script.yaml",
    output_path="output/anime_episode",
    base_model="anythingv5",
    lora_models=["anime_style_lora"],
    render_fps=24,
    output_fps=60,
    frame_interpolation_enabled=True,
    language="en"
)
```

### Processing Game Recording
```python
from backend.pipelines.channel_specific.gaming_pipeline import GamingPipeline

pipeline = GamingPipeline()
result = pipeline.run(
    input_path="gameplay.mp4",
    output_path="output/gaming_content",
    base_model="stable_diffusion_xl",
    render_fps=30,
    output_fps=60,
    frame_interpolation_enabled=True
)
```

## Quality Assurance
All pipelines implement:
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time database updates
- **Quality Validation**: Output verification
- **Resource Management**: GPU memory optimization
- **Logging**: Detailed operation tracking

## Performance Considerations
- **Maximum Quality Focus**: No performance optimizations
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA/OpenCL support where available
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and optimization
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded where possible
- **Caching**: Model and asset caching for efficiency

## Future Enhancements
- Additional combat scene types
